# Rock-Paper-Scissors-in-Web-Browser

There is a bunch of stuff here: a node.js server file, a rock-paper-scissors HTML/CSS file, a JavaScript file, four JSON files, and a generic home HTML file.
The node server runs on localhost:8080, and the address should be "http://localhost:8080/Assignment9.html". Pressing certain buttons on the website will update the HTML file with the data from the JSON files asynchronously. Any other web address will take you to the home HTML file.
